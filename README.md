# 📘 Machine Learning Guides

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Guides** repository!  
This repo is a curated collection of clear, practical use cases of Machine Learning — implemented entirely through code.

Each folder or script here demonstrates how to solve a real-world problem or apply an ML concept using Python and popular ML libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- ✅ Practical, working ML code examples
- ✅ Solutions for real-world problems
- ✅ Clean, beginner-friendly implementation
- ✅ No fluff — just code that works

## 🎯 Goal

This repository is meant to:

* Help you **learn by doing**
* Serve as a **reference** for common ML tasks
* Act as a **codebase** you can build on for your own projects


## 🤝 Contributions
